# importmap

## Two usages:
1. Use your own JSON
  - This is managed on your own, but you can also use the CLI to vendor stuff for you
  - If you need to preload any imports, you must use ImportMap and specify each import
2. Use the libraries ImportMap
  - This is useful if you just want to use CDNs
  - You can also use this for your own application JS code
